### `Inspiration` <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BkNrGhy4DKnbD9u/giphy.gif" width = "30" height= "25">

This is a self-inspired project and saw its requisite when I had to travel from `Houston,Texas` to `Springfield, Virginia`. During this driving journey, I ran into multiple thunderstorms and it made my journey overall arduous.   

### `Core functionality` <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> 
Following are the two core functionalities 
- Weather information (temperature, thunderstorm, clear sky and so on) along the journey route.
- Detailed directions along with expected date-time.
