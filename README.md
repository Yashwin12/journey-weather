Journey-weather is an easy to use: simply give the start and end point of your journey, and date-time you want to start. Then click on 'Let's go'. You will see the route you can travel along with the weather forecast for each stage at the time we expect you to be passing.

### `Inspiration` <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BkNrGhy4DKnbD9u/giphy.gif" width = "30" height= "25">

This project was inspired by my long trip back home to `Virginia` from `Texas` to be with my family during COVID-19 pandemic. During the journey, I faced multiple thunderstorms and weather obstacles that made my journey much more arduous. 

### `Core functionality` <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> 

Following are the two core functionalities 
- Weather information (temperature, thunderstorm, clear sky and so on) along the journey route.
- Detailed directions along with expected date-time.

As Journey-weather is uing `free` version of the APIs, one might run into few issues but not limited to HTTP 429 - too many requests.
